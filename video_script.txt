VIDEO SCRIPT: Zookeeper's Challenge
-----------------------------------

[SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION]
Action: Face the camera or show the title screen of your code editor.
Audio: 
"Hi, this is [Your Name], and this is my submission for the Zookeeper's Challenge assignment. 
The goal of this program is to manage a dynamic zoo environment by processing animal data, 
generating unique attributes, and organizing them into a population report."

[SECTION 2: ARCHITECTURE & LOGIC]
Action: Screen share your VS Code window showing 'zookeeper_challenge.py'.
Audio:
"I structured my Python solution using a modular approach. The main logic resides in the 
'process_zoo_data' function, which orchestrates the reading, processing, and writing of data.

I created three key helper functions to handle specific tasks:
1. 'load_names': This reads the animalNames.txt file and parses it into a dictionary, allowing 
   me to easily pop names off the list for each species.
2. 'gen_unique_id': This generates IDs like 'Hy01' or 'Li02'. It uses a global dictionary 
   to track the count of each species found so far.
3. 'gen_birth_date': This calculates the birth date. It subtracts the animal's age from the 
   current year and uses a dictionary to map seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) to specific dates."

[SECTION 3: PARSING LOGIC]
Action: Scroll to the loop inside 'process_zoo_data' (around line 85).
Audio:
"For parsing the input file, I read 'arrivingAnimals.txt' line by line. Since the data is 
comma-separated, I split the string and then extract specific attributes. 

For example, I parse the first segment to get age and sex, and look for keywords like 'born in' 
to determine the season. This allows me to handle variations in the input data dynamically."

[SECTION 4: DEMONSTRATION]
Action: Open the terminal in VS Code. Ensure 'zooPopulation.txt' does not exist or delete it first to show it being created.
Audio:
"Now, let's see it in action. I have my input files ready here. I will run the script from the terminal."

Action: Type 'python3 zookeeper_challenge.py' and hit Enter.
Audio:
"The script runs successfully and tells us the report has been generated."

[SECTION 5: REVIEWING OUTPUT]
Action: Open the newly created 'zooPopulation.txt' file.
Audio:
"If we open the 'zooPopulation.txt' file, we can see the results. 
The animals are correctly organized by habitat: Hyena, Lion, Bear, and Tiger.

Each entry includes the generated Unique ID, the assigned Name from our list, the calculated 
birth date, and the other attributes parsed from the input. You can see the IDs increment 
correctly for each species."

[SECTION 6: CONCLUSION]
Action: Briefly show code or face camera.
Audio:
"This project helped me practice file I/O, string manipulation, and modular function design in Python. 
Thank you for watching!"
